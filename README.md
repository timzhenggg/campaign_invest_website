## Update Access for Investment Page

To manage access permissions for the investment page, you can edit the `users.json` file located in the root directory (`campaign_invest_website`). This file contains user data and access settings. 

### Steps to Update Access
1. Open the `users.json` in root directory
2. Locate the user entry you'd like to update.
3. Modify the necessary fields, such as access level, permissions, or any other relevant information.

These changes will take effect immediately upon the next application build or reload.
