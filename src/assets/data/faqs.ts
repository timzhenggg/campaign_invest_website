      "Besides EV’s global surge and expected dominance as cities grow, there’s a fast growing need for space-efficient urban transportation. Our micro-EVs cater to this demand and more. The new estimate by McKinsey, indicating that the Total Addressable Market for micro-EVs is $470 Billion, strongly reinforces our strategic position. Breakthroughs in battery technology enable us to produce high-quality, affordable micro-EVs, addressing changing consumer preferences toward practical, cost-effective, and sustainable transportation options. The convergence of these factors, along with new technologies and service-based business models, creates a unique window of opportunity for disruption in the transportation industry. By capitalizing on this moment, we position ourselves at the forefront of a significant shift in urban mobility."

In 2023, the introduction of Eli Energy as a new business unit involved selling solar products to business customers, contributing to cash flow. While not the core business, this diversification strategy adds to overall financial stability. Future plans include the development of vehicle-related services such as connectivity, subscription models, and additional warranties to further boost revenue and margins."

In the EU micro-EV market, our vehicle stands out for its appeal and advanced automotive features, including cooling AC. In the US market, Eli enjoys unparalleled positioning as a pioneer in the microcar segment, engineered for passenger comfort and safety. Eli ZERO adheres to NHTSA and FMVSS regulations, transcending typical LSV and NEV standards. Blending passenger car features into a microcar sets us apart. Engineered for daily trips at a competitive price, our vehicles position us as the premium choice, redefining excellence in urban mobility."

      "There will always be some risk involved when investing in a startup or small business. And the earlier you get in the more risk that is usually present. If a young company goes out of business, your ownership interest could lose all value. You may have limited voting power to direct the company due to dilution over time. You may also have to wait about five to seven years (if ever) for an exit via acquisition, IPO, etc. Because early-stage companies are still in the process of perfecting their products, services, and business model, nothing is guaranteed. That’s why startups should only be part of a more balanced, overall investment portfolio."

The Company goes public (makes an initial public offering). In those instances, you receive your pro-rata share of the distributions that occur, in the case of acquisition, or you can sell your shares on an exchange. These are both considered long-term exits, taking approximately 5-10 years (and often longer) to see the possibility for an exit. It can sometimes take years to build companies.
